## Reason for rejection

### Review Environment

Submission ID: 9dcf2f23-df24-48d3-9fcb-0b7f1a1d92df
Review date: January 12, 2025
Version reviewed: 1.0.0

### Guideline 5.1.1 - Legal - Privacy - Data Collection and Storage

#### Issue Description

One or more purpose strings in the app do not sufficiently explain the use of protected resources. Purpose strings must clearly and completely describe the app's use of data and, in most cases, provide an example of how the data will be used.

#### Next Steps

Update the camera, photo library, microphone, and location purpose string to explain how the app will use the requested information and provide a specific example of how the data will be used. See the attached screenshot.

#### Resources

Purpose strings must clearly describe how an app uses the ability, data, or resource. The following are hypothetical examples of unclear purpose strings that would not pass review:

- "App would like to access your Contacts"
- "App needs microphone access"

See examples of [helpful, informative purpose strings](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/privacy#Requesting-permission). The information about purpose strings from [Apple's Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/privacy#Requesting-permission) is also available locally in the [Permission Request Guidelines](requesting_permission.md)
